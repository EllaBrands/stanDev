## 1. Tests and test requirements.

The [Stan developer process](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Developer-Process#new-and-altered-code-is-tested) specifies that all new and altered code should be tested.  We believe that good test coverage is necessary given the size and complexity of the Stan code base (or any code base consisting of more than a Perl 1-liner, and quite frankly, we don't trust that Perl 1-liner). 

We know that there are many bugs in our code.  With good test coverage, when a bug is found, these tests allow us to demonstrate:
 - that the bug exists, by writing a test which tickles the bug and causes failure
 - that the bug has been fixed, by showing that the new test no longer fails
 - that the change has not introduced new bugs, by re-running all other existing tests.

We'll try to describe some of the implementation details of the tests for Stan.

- Test naming convention
    
    All tests are named `*_test.cpp` and are located in subdirectories of `src/test`.
    
    The test executable for `src/test/*_test.cpp` will be created at `test/*` (add `.exe` for Windows). The rule is to strip the leading `src/` and the `_test.cpp` from the filename.
    
- How to run a specific test
    
    The make target is test executable. For example, if the test is located at `src/test/foo/bar_test.cpp`, the command to build the test is ```> make test/foo/bar```.
    
    We tooled the makefile to run the test on a build. We have a second target to force running of the test, even if it is built. 
    ```> make runtest/test/foo/bar```
    (add the prefix `runtest/`)

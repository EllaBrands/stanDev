The models in [Data Analysis Using Regression Analysis and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill have been translated into Stan. The associated R code is also available and the graphics have been translated into ggplot2. Special thanks to Sergio Polini for contributing a fair amount of code for the ARM models and associated graphics. Note that a fair amount of the data from the book is missing (or different) so some models may produce slightly different results.

The models are sorted by...

* [Chapter](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/ARM-Models-Sorted-by-Chapter)

* [Name](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/ARM-Models-Sorted-by-Name)

* [Model Type](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/ARM-Models-Sorted-by-Type)

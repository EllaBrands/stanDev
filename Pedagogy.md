# Stan Pedagogy Efforts

[Intro To Stan page](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Intro-To-Stan)

Basic education constituencies defined by those willing to teach/create materials.

## Private-sector Managers / Public-sector Policy Makers

### Prerequisites
* No stats
* No programming

### Goals
* Avoid getting technical with under-the-hood details.
* Demonstrate value of reasoning over posteriors, hierarchal modeling, and overall considerations of uncertainty.
* Promote Stan adoption in private and public sector

### Delivery
* 3 hour course would be ideal.
* Active testing for development of materials.
* Active testing during delivery.
* Meetups are a likely venue for testing/development.

### Writers/teachers
* Breck/Jonathan/Lauren: 


## Programmers w/o Stats Backgrounds

### Prerequisites
* Programming skills
* No stats presupposed
* Basic algebra (not calc)

### Goals
* Goal is to get users comfortable with pooling models, as in Bob's baseball case study or the Radon case study.
* Get a large user group interested in learning Stan. 
### Delivery
* Course Length unknown.
* In person, online.
### Writers/Teachers
* Breck/Sean/Mitzi


## Intro Applied Bayesian Stats

### Goals
* Creative basic modeling and fitting in Stan
* Smooth the road to using Stan for those who are pretty close to having the skills to use it but lack knowledge of Stan specifically and Bayesian analysis. 

### Syllabus
Five courses of roughly five weeks each, with 1--2 hours of lecture/per week and roughly 8--10 total hours/week presupposed

* Intro Probability
* Intro Bayes
* Intro MCMC
* Intro Stan
* Hierarchical and Multilevle Regression

### Prerequisites
* Basic calculus, understands notation, overall idea of derivatives, integrals, and series.
* Basic programming.


### Delivery
* Self study
* 40 contact hours of online resources (8 hours/course)
    - ideally divided into 5--10 minute segments with both basic drills in the mechanics and more open-ended exercises
* Simultaneously write the Stan Book
* Test run material in meetups

### Writers/Teachers
* Bob/Andrew/Advait/...

## Other groups we could serve
* Scientists that don't know how to program but use stats packages. Scientists who program in statistical languages like R and want to do Bayesian analyses. RStanArm users. 
* Lay public
* Journalists

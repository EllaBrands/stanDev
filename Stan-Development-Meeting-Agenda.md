### Roundtable
_Short (less than 1 minute) description of work in the past week._

### Unresolved Topics
_Address any open topics from the past meeting._

1. Bob Carpenter.  What do we need to do for 2.10 release and when can we time it for minimal disruption?  Description of steps necessary to release 2.10 and target date.  The only thing I know holding us back at the moment is verifying that the changes to HMC haven't made things worse for warmup (Sebastian's examples).

2. Bob Carpenter.  Should I go ahead and support the following two changes:
    - `target +=` in transformed parameters: this was unresolved
    - PRNGs in transformed data: this was resolved as as "yes"

* Bob.  Should we save variables declared at top of model block and avoid having to duplicate work in generated quantities?  Decision.
* Bob.  Should we have a `jacobian +=` statement that increments the Jacobian and whose inclusion in the log density is controlled by the Jacobian template parameter?  Decision.
* Daniel. Stan refactor. [stan-dev/stan#1751](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/issues/1751). The pull request is in place for Stan, CmdStan, and RStan. I'll discuss with Allen in person next week. It needs to be reviewed. Once reviewed, we can decide to merge it now or wait until we have the 3 major interfaces ready to go.

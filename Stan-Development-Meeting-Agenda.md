Carpenter.  What should we do about PyStan licensing?  It sounds like Allen wants to keep it copylefted to prevent for-profits from using it without sharing their code.  I'd rather it be BSD-ed.  I'd be in favor of allocating project resources to create a BSD-ed Python interface.  Something lightweight around CmdStan could also avoid all the installation headaches that seem to be endemic to linking through C++.  There's no mechanism to force Allen to more liberally license PyStan because he or his employer owns the copyright.  I've talked to Allen about this, and I don't see an alternative.  Already, many people are building these lightweight wrappers anyway in industry (I know of at least two documented cases).  A related issue if we fork is what to do with PyStan as it stands.

Carpenter.  Web page governance?  We have no way to decide what should go on the web pages as nobody's in charge of them.  I built the first version of the pages.  Michael launched the second version, but I substantially modified the organization over time as new things got added.  Then Michael completely rebuilt the pages recently to organize around "about" and "users" and "developers" at the top level rather than "docs" and "interfaces", etc. at the top level.   Andrew has different ideas of how they should be organized (I think he wants only two tabs---so I wanted seven or eight, Michael used about half that, and Andrew wants to cut it in half again).  Given that we have roughly zero expertise in web design and measurements, it didn't seem like arguments would amount to anything other than "I think it'll be better this way."

Gelman.  Stan books.  I talked with our editor at CRC about the Bayes Econ book (with Jim Savage and others) and the Stan book.  We should figure out how difficult it would be to put together the Stan book:  maybe we already have 90% from existing materials?  It would be good to be able to do this without it feeling like "work."

Gelman.  Blue-sky ideas for Keck grant:  https://research.columbia.edu/content/2018-keck-foundation-research-grants

Gelman:  Datacamp and Coursera (again).

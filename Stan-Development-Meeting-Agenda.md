Bob Carpenter.  What do we need to do for 2.10 release and when can we time it for minimal disruption?  Description of steps necessary to release 2.10 and target date.  The only thing I know holding us back at the moment is verifying that the changes to HMC haven't made things worse for warmup (Sebastian's examples).

### Open Discussion Topics
_Any topics that do not need to be addressed in the short term,
including speculation and brainstorming._

* __Developer name.  Short description.__

* Bob Carpenter.  Should I go ahead and support the following two changes:
    - `target +=` in transformed parameters

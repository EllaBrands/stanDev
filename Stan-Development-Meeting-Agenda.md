### Roundtable
_Short (less than 1 minute) description of work in the past week._

### Unresolved Topics
_Address any open topics from the past meeting._

Andrew and Dustin.  GMO.  Dustin will present some GMO results and we can discuss plans for implementing in Stan.
(Andrew needs to leave Stan meeting 11:30 so it would be good to have this discussion early in the meeting.)

Andrew. Hiring. We should look at some applicants.  No rush but we shouldn't wait too long.

### New Topics
_New topics that should be addressed immediately or by the next
meeting._

* __Developer name.  Short description.  Desired resolution.__

Bob.  Power tests/experimental design for measurements for stiff soil-carbon compartment models.  Some suggestions on how to go about it.

Bob.  Google Summer of Code through NumFOCUS (they'll do paperwork).  Get projects if anyone's interested in mentoring.

### Open Discussion Topics
_Any topics that do not need to be addressed in the short term,
including speculation and brainstorming._

* __Developer name.  Short description.__

Andrew. In one week, we hope to have a clear demonstration that GMO works and then we can discuss implementation in Stan.

Andrew. Priors for rstanarm.

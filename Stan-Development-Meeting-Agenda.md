29 Nov.  Andrew.  Stan in Rstudio sending output to viewer.

29 Nov.  Andrew.  Writing articles that are based on case studies.

29 Nov.  Andrew.  Stan license.

29 Nov.  Andrew.  "Stan This Month"

28 Nov.  StanCon2019 is in Cambridge: Some general questions, request for feedback.

28th Nov. Aki/Yuling. ADVI diagnostic needs logq and logp, what to call them in csv?

14th Nov. Charles. Do we want a Newton solver in Stan. When would it work better in than Powell's method.

14th Nov. Charles. Do we want an optimization function (i.e. max objective function).

15 Nov. Matthijs: Functions reference document is broken.

All below old and done?

10/30 . Ben . Can we either sign the Mac clang4/6 installer or front the $100 Apple Developer Tax? Yes

1st Nov. Sebastian. Can we have an optional `coupled_ode_system` in stan-math which enables an easy way to provide analytic Jacobians for ODE solving (leads to >2x speedups for cases I have seen)? We could allow for this using compile time flags, for example.

1st Nov. Sebastian. Does it make sense to have ODE integrators provide the solutions of the states with higher relative accuracy vs the gradients? Does it buy sampling performance something (knowing lp more precisely vs the gradients is worthwhile, I think)? Are we up to yet another ODE call?

### Open Discussion Topics

25 Oct. Charles. Bayes for big data: HMC with stochastic gradients?

_Any topics that do not need to be addressed in the short term,
including speculation and brainstorming._

### Roundtable
_Short (less than 1 minute) description of work in the past week._


### Unresolved Topics
_Address any open topics from the past meeting._

### New Topics
_New topics that should be addressed immediately or by the next
meeting._

* __Developer name.  Short description.  Desired resolution.__

* Charles. Stan 2.18 release.
 
* Sebastian+Ben. Logic for cmdstan mass matrix reloading and num_warmup=0/engaged=1 issue.

* Sebastian. Interest in more parallel stuff? Short documentation in wiki on `operands_and_partials` asynchronous execution concept which is an alternative to OpenMP. Pro: general/no need for MPI/Stan programs stay as they are; Con: I don't have time to do it any time soon.

* Sebastian. Sparse matrices. Any hope for a solution soon? For example, a function which is unsafe to use in addition to what we have with big warnings (sorry if I missed any of this, but this is important for many models).

### Open Discussion Topics

including speculation and brainstorming._

* __Developer name.  Short description.__

* Andrew.  Verbose options in output.

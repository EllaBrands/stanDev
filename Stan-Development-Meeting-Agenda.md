Andrew.  Nonidentifiability in symmetric probabilistic matrix factorization model.

Charles. For algebraic solver: evaluating the Jacobian of the solver with respect to the parameters. I'm a little confused about which variables are fixed and which ones vary.

Charles. Passing tuning parameters for ODEs in higher-order function. Function gets properly parsed, math unit tests work, but final implementation doesn't.

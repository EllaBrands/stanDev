### Roundtable
_Short (less than 1 minute) description of work in the past week._

### Unresolved Topics
_Address any open topics from the past meeting._

### New Topics
_New topics that should be addressed immediately or by the next
meeting._

* __Developer name.  Short description.  Desired resolution.__

- Betancourt.  Should we kill Stan Core?  Delete or not to delete.
- Daniel. Non-safe use of external packages. Not good.
- Daniel. Additional projects on stan-dev. Should we have a process before adding things? There's a gelman organization that's a good candidate for projects that are just starting out. Repos in question:
  * projpred
  * gmo
  * bayesplot
  * loo (?)
  * stat_comp_benchmarks
  * visual-diagnostics
  * nomad

  I'm not suggesting we push them out immediately, but I'm not sure how we're spawning new projects. If we're limiting discourse to just things that are on stan-dev, then I want to make sure we're ok with additions.

### Open Discussion Topics
_Any topics that do not need to be addressed in the short term,
including speculation and brainstorming._

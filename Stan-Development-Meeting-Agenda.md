### Roundtable
_Short (less than 1 minute) description of work in the past week._


### Unresolved Topics
_Address any open topics from the past meeting._

### New Topics
_New topics that should be addressed immediately or by the next
meeting._

* __Developer name.  Short description.  Desired resolution.__
 
* Sebastian. MPI / non-MPI runs exact reproducibility. See [here for details](http://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/non-exact-reproducibility-issue-with-different-ad-schemes-possible/2693/2). Do we require exact reproducibility for MPI / non-MPI runs. I guess the same applies for GPU / non-GPU runs.

* Sebastian. MPI test system. How to handle special MPI needs, see my [question here](http://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/gpu-ci-testing/2572/7). Guidance on what to do with MPI tests given they have to be disabled on some contexts.

* Matthijs. Master's projects. I'd like to advertise two possible thesis projects for MSc students, here in Oxford: one on the reliability of VI and one on compiler optimisations for probabilistic programming. The idea is that both would involve using and hopefully contributing to Stan. I'd like to see if anyone has any suggestions / comments.

### Open Discussion Topics
_Any topics that do not need to be addressed in the short term,
including speculation and brainstorming._

* __Developer name.  Short description.__


Andrew.  We can briefly review all the papers/projects we're working on with Dan, Aki, etc.  I think there are about 10 of them (GMO, hlm's, weak priors, simulation-based checking, Bayesian workflow, a few more I can't remember right now).

Andrew.  Stan demo and movie.

Andrew.  Stan manual:  add change-point models.

Andrew.  Stan modeling cheat sheet.

Andrew.  Stan intro material.

Sebastian. Upgrade to CVODES 2.9.0? Decision.

Sebastian. Usage of BOOST_(UN)LIKELY?
   * Pro: Wider compiler support (gcc, clang, intel,..), header-only, boost community keeps up with it
   * Con: Intended for internal boost libraries only according to boost
   => Evaluate performance and use?

Carpenter.  Fail at run time rather than compile time if the parser can't resolve integrate_ode argument is data?  Decision.

Daniel.     Refactor status: Stan ready. CmdStan and RStan good to go. Could I have help testing RStan? Once PyStan is good, can we merge?

Aki. Features making implementation of EP-life and GMO easier.

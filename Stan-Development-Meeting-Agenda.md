10/30 . Ben . Can we either sign the Mac clang4/6 installer or front the $100 Apple Developer Tax? Yes

1st Nov. Sebastian. Can we have an optional `coupled_ode_system` in stan-math which enables an easy way to provide analytic Jacobians for ODE solving (leads to >2x speedups for cases I have seen)? We could allow for this using compile time flags, for example.

1st Nov. Sebastian. Does it make sense to have ODE integrators provide the solutions of the states with higher relative accuracy vs the gradients? Does it buy sampling performance something (knowing lp more precisely vs the gradients is worthwhile, I think)? Are we up to yet another ODE call?

1 Nov. Andrew. Blog, publicity, etc.

1 Nov. Andrew. Constrained and unconstrained parameters.

### Open Discussion Topics

25 Oct. Charles. Bayes for big data: HMC with stochastic gradients?

_Any topics that do not need to be addressed in the short term,
including speculation and brainstorming._

### Roundtable
_Short (less than 1 minute) description of work in the past week._


### Unresolved Topics
_Address any open topics from the past meeting._

### New Topics
_New topics that should be addressed immediately or by the next
meeting._

* __Developer name.  Short description.  Desired resolution.__

* Daniel. Allow everyone to post on the "Developers" category on [Discourse](http://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/proposal-remove-restriction-on-developer-category-within-discourse/2269)? Resolution: decide on whether to do this or not.

  More detail: there's currently a poll in the discourse thread. The count is currently 5-2 (in favor of opening up the Developers category vs. leaving it as read-all, write after approval). Although it's a poll, we don't need to leave this to a vote if we think it's better one way or another.


### Open Discussion Topics
_Any topics that do not need to be addressed in the short term,
including speculation and brainstorming._

* __Developer name.  Short description.__

Andrew.  I'll be at Stan meeting on Thurs 2 Nov and can bring up lots of agenda items:

Andrew.  Can we add a missing-data type to avoid ugly hashing.  Yes I know it will only work with continuous missing data but still.

Andrew.  ScalaStan being developed by people at CIBO.

Andrew.  We can briefly review all the papers/projects we're working on with Dan, Aki, etc.  I think there are about 10 of them (GMO, hlm's, weak priors, simulation-based checking, Bayesian workflow, a few more I can't remember right now).

Andrew.  Coursera update.

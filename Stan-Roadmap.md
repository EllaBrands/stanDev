# Stan Road Map

This document is a broad plan for the future direction of the
*software products* of the Stan project.  Stan is very much a group
effort and we welcome contributions at every stage of software
develoment: algorithms, API design, coding, documentation, and testing.
If you're interested in getting involved in development, here's the [Stan developers home page](http://mc-stan.org/developers/).

#### Open source licensing

Stan's code and documentation will remain 100% open source (the core is BSD, interfaces vary).

#### Software governance

The Stan project is managed as a whole by the Stan Governing Body (SGB).   The software component of Stan is managed by the Technical Working Group (TWG) at the discretion of the SGB. The TWG has a chair plus technical leads for each of the functional areas of Stan's software:

* Chair (stan-dev): Bob Carpenter
* Math Library (stan-dev/math): Daniel Lee
* Language (stan-dev/stan): Sean Talts
* Algorithms (stan-dev/stan):  Michael Betancourt
* CmdStan (stan-dev/cmdstan):  Mitzi Morris
* PyStan (stan-dev/pystan): Allen Riddell
* RStan (stan-dev/rstan): Ben Goodrich
    * RStanArm (stan-dev/rstanarm): Ben Goodrich
    * rstantools (stan-dev/rstantoolds): Jonah Gabry
    * bayesplot (stan-dev/bayesplot): Jonah Gabry
    * loo (stan-dev/loo): Jonah Gabry
    * ShinyStan (stan-dev/shinystan): Jonah Gabry
    * brms (paul-buerkner/brms): Paul BÃ¼rkner
* MatlabStan (brian-lau/MatlabStan): Brian Lau
* Stan.jl (goedman/Stan.jl): Rob Goedman
* StataStan (stan-dev/statastan): Robert Grant
* MathematicaStan (stan-dev/MathematicaStan):  Vincent Picaud

In addition to the software, we also have:

* Stan Web site (stan-dev/stan-dev.io.github): Breck Baldwin

There are many other packages using Stan that are not managed by the Stan project directly, so they are not included here (e.g., ScalaStan).

#### Stan 3

After we've gathered all the interface changes we think we want to keep
for a longer run and have run a while with existing functionality
deprecated, we will release Stan 3 and remove all the old deprecated
functionality.  This will break backward compatibility.  It is very unlikely to happen in 2018.

PyStan 3 will happen earlier to enable ISC (non-copyleft) licensing;  it won't coincide with any change in the language.


# Math Library Roadmap
* *Repository*: `stan-dev/math`
* *Manager*: Daniel Lee

#### GPU parallelism
* Underlying matrix opertion implementations
* Push data to GPUs
* Initially target quadratic data, cubic operation functions: Cholesky decomposition, log determinant, matrix multiply

#### OpenMP parallelism (multiple threads)
* within Eigen for some matrix operations
* parallelize double calculations in distribution functions

#### Autodiff testing framework
* document what we currently have
* extend to multivariate input types (matrix, vector, array)
* extend to integer types (arguments only---return doesn't need
  autodiff)
* extend to vectorized functions including reductions like distributions and pointwise vectorizations like the math functions

#### C++11 upgrades
* simplify code with C++11 `auto`, foreach, lambdas, etc.

#### Efficiency upgrades
* reduce copying and support Eigen expression templates with more generic arguments

#### Metaprogram unification
* remove redundant metaprograms
* extend boundary conditions of existing programs

#### Vectorization framework
* framework to allow easy vectorization beyond unary scalars

#### Sparse matrix arithmetic
* basic implementations on top of Eigen
* analytic derivatives

#### Internals documentation
* explain code organization
* explain metaprograms and utility classes
* examples of how to implement and test different kinds of functions

#### Remove scal/array/matrix distinction
* Collect `scal`, `arr`, `mat` into single files under top-level organization

#### Performance monitoring and testing
* Add a way to measure speed between branches

# Language Roadmap
* *Repository*: `stan-dev/stan`
* *Manager*: Bob Carpenter

#### Multi-core parallelism
* Generic `map()` function which may be configured to use MPI with
  local data

#### Data types and operations
* *Simply typed functions*: application, abstraction with binding
   (i.e., lambdas with closures)
* *64-bit integers*:  replace current 32-bit implementation
* *Tuples*: statically typed sequences of heterogeneous types
* *Ragged arrays*: contain elements of the same shape, but varying sizes
* *Sparse matrices, vectors*: plus arithmtic, solvers
* *Boolean*: to allow easy selection; subtype of `int`

#### Calculus functions
* Differential algebraic equation (DAE) solver
* Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers
* Definite integrators, bounded and unbounded

#### General functions
* Compound generalized linear models (GLM)
* approximate GLM (a la INLA)
* Hidden Markov models (HMM)
* Gaussian process (GP) covariance functions
* Vectorization including n-ary functions, multivariate functions,
  multivariate distributions, and comparison operators

#### Documentation
* Break current manual into user's guide, language spec, and
  supporting materials
* Move manuals to HTML format with bookdown (R markdown)
* Produce formal syntax and semantics
* Parser, abstract syntax tree, generator code (dev facing)

#### Covariance
Make Stan fully covariant so any function or assignment to a type may
be used with a subtype.
* every type is a subtype of itself
* `int` is a subtype of `real`
* `A[]` is a subtype of `B[]` if `A` is a subtype of `B`
* `A -> B` is a subtype of `C -> D` if `C` is a subtype of `A` and `B`
  is a subtype of `D`

#### User-defined functions with analytic gradients
* Allow users to specify analytic gradients for functions
* Test framework for correctness of user's definition

#### Error diagnostics
* Improve user interpretability of error messages with suggestions for
  remediation
* Vectorize error handling in math lib to include positions everywhere
* Pedantic mode/lint system to take over from existing heuristics
  (eliminating parser false positive warnings)
* Remove false positive compiler warnings

#### Compilation efficiency
Most of this speedup will come through algorithms and the math library.

#### Model combinators
* Combine models consisting of parameters, data, and log density
contributions.

#### Plug-in extensions
Allow users to define new functions in C++ and easily include them in
Stan; this is much more powerful with function types.

#### Flexible derivatives for subsets of parameters
Allow a subset of parameters to be fixed and derivatives only
calculated for remainder.

#### Standoff abstract syntax tree (dev facing)
* Simple s-expressions rather than variant types to allow easy
  generation and intermediate transformation
* Pretty printer from abstract syntax tree

#### Model class (dev facing)
* properly modularized abstract base class to enable easy
  implementation by clients
* constant correctness
* flexible, structured access to declared variable declarations, data
  values, and transforms

#### Stan 3 language
* blockless model a la SlicStan with full functions
* target for StataStan or a new embedded PyStan
* rethink Spirit Qi parser choice; target standoff AST


# Algorithms Roadmap

#### Smooth warmup
* instead of blocked adaptation, add rolling average that adapts smoothly
* challenge will be getting step size adapted at the same time

#### Timed and sample size budgeted processing
* set a time budget, and try to generate largest n_eff in that time
* set an n_eff budget, and run only long enough to get there
* start with better estimated finish times

#### Online progress monitor (GUI)
* online monitoring of means, variances, R-hat with Welford's algorithm
* report summaries in output

#### Simulation-based calibration (SBC)
* methodology for large-scale, precise calibration generalizing the
  approach of Cook, Gelman and Rubin
* implementing necessary services for methodology

#### Autodiff-based variational inference (ADVI)
Approximate Bayes with variational inference with multivariate normal
variational family (on the unconstrained scale) and a nested Monte
Carlo estimate of the gradient of an expectation.
* diagnose optimization failures
* diagnose approximation failures
* develop adaptation and optimization algorithms
* explore alternative family parameterizations

#### Gradient-based Marginal Optimization (GMO)
Used for marginal posterior modes or max marginal likelihood (MML).
* develop algorithm
* validate vs. lme4

#### Expectation propgation
Used for data-parallel approximate Bayes.
* choose version to use, tuning params, etc.
* implement serial version in C++ using Stan's log density and gradient

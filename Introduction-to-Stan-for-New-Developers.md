Welcome to Stan!  We're excited that you are interested in contributing to the project.  Before you can contribute you will have to familiarize yourself with the particular processes for new contributions that we have incorporated to facilitate the growth of the project.

Firstly, the Stan project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/stan-dev) so you will have to create a GitHub account if you do not yet already have one.  Secondly, developer discussions are [hosted on Discourse](http://discourse.mc-stan.org) so you will have to create an account there in order to ask questions or participate in discussions.

Every developer has their own local development setup, but we have compiled [various helpful ](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Dev:-Tricks) that you might find useful.

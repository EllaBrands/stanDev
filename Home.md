# Stan Developer Wiki

## General Stan resources

This is the top-level Wiki for Stan developers.  User-facing information can be found on the 

* [Stan project home page](http://mc-stan.org/).

If you have any questions about using Stan or Stan development, please feel free to ask on the 

* [Stan forums](http://discourse.mc-stan.org).

## Developer Wikis

This section provides a complete list of developer-facing Wikis hosted in this repo.

### "Roadmap"

The Roadmap Wikipage was removed as it was not convenient for discussing plans. [Stan-dev design documents repo](https://github.com/stan-dev/design-docs) lists design documents and functional specs that attempt to describe major changes to our code base. Recent design docs and pull requests for new design docs also indicate potential new major features. Github pull request discussion and review features are used to improve design docs before actual implementation starts.

### Contributing to Stan without C++/OCaml experience

* [Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Coding-Style-and-Idioms).

### Contributing new functions and algorithms

There is a wiki page about

* [Contributing New Functions](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Contributing-New-Functions-to-Stan)

and a separate page for

* [Proposing New Algorithms](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Proposing-Algorithms-for-Inclusion-Into-Stan).

### Testing frameworks

## Prior choice wiki

Until it can be moved to the user's guide, this repo will continue to host the

* [Prior Choice Wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations).

We'll try to describe some of the implementation details of the tests for Stan.

- Test naming convention

All tests are named `*_test.cpp` and are located in subdirectories of `src/test`.

The test executable for `src/test/*_test.cpp` will be created at `test/*` (add `.exe` for Windows). The rule is to strip the leading `src/` and the `_test.cpp` from the filename.

- How to run a specific test

The make target is test executable. For example, if the test is located at `src/test/foo/bar_test.cpp`, the command to build the test is ```> make test/foo/bar```.

We tooled the makefile to run the test on a build. We have a second target to force running of the test, even if it is built. 
```> make runtest/test/foo/bar```
(add the prefix `runtest/`)

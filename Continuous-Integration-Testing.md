To restart a Travis job, here are @syclik's instructions:

1. Log into https://travis-ci.org with your GitHub credentials. It'll pull up all the repos you have access to on the left.
2. Find the job that's broken. Here's an example: I clicked on the "stan-dev/stan" link (in green) on the left. Then I clicked on "Branches". Here, you can see that "feature/issue-2012-make" has an error.

3. Click on the red "#1750 errored" link. That's the build that's broken. It'll bring up a view of all the build jobs that it kicked off. I've scrolled down a little here to show a couple of the broken build jobs:

4. Click on one of the red links. Here, I clicked on "1750.18". It'll pull up detail of the build. I added the green arrows.

5. Restart! Click on the the icon I've marked with green arrows. The hover-over tool-tip says "Restart job"
